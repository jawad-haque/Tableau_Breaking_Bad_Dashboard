🎨 Exploring Tableau with Breaking Bad! 🚀

As I continue diving deeper into Tableau, I decided to analyse one of my all-time favourite TV shows—Breaking Bad—to enhance my visualization skills and storytelling with data.

Here’s what I visualized:
 • 📊 Episodes by Season: A clear look at how the number of episodes evolved across the five seasons.
 • ⭐ IMDB Ratings by Season: A box plot showing the distribution of ratings, with Season 5 consistently delivering top-notch episodes.
 • 📈 U.S. Viewers by Year: A line chart revealing the show’s massive growth in viewership over time, peaking in the final season.
 • 🕒 Episode Duration and Total Breakdown: A donut chart highlighting the binge-worthy 62-episode journey!
 • 🎬 Key Directors and Creators: A word cloud showcasing the incredible talent behind the show, with names like Michelle MacLaren and Vince Gilligan standing out.
 • 📌 Bullet Points Summary: Essential facts like the IMDB rating, episode details, and the show’s premise—all at a glance.

📚 What I Learned:
 • Combining multiple chart types to tell a cohesive story.
 • Using Tableau’s features to create visually engaging and meaningful insights.
 • How much fun it is to use creative datasets like this one to hone my skills!
